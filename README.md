# TSM Lights App
Final project built by the TSM 2022-1 group.

This project consists on an Android app, capable of turning on the lights of a house with a variety of ways:

* Turn on a certain light by pressing a button, with a certain intensity
* Turn on a certain light using your voice, with a variety of commands
* Turn on the lights by getting close a certain distance from your home

You can also change the intensity, turn off the lights or send messages with the SOS function.
